      Don't underestimate the Force. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
      You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!
      Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm
      in for it as it is. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send
      a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander.
      There'll be no one to stop us this time! Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
      I don't know, what do you think? What good is a reward if you ain't around
      to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of
      courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide. Look, I can take you as far as
      Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
      going. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's
      late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You
      weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed
      to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans
      they sent you. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
      presence of my old master. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Don't
      underestimate the Force. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's
      nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a
      Jedi, like my father before me. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no
      match for a good blaster at your side, kid. The Force is strong with this
      one. I have you now. Red Five standing by. Don't be too proud of this
      technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet
      is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
